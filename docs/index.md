# OTOBO Znuny Python Client

Welcome to the documentation for the OTOBO / Znuny REST API Python client. This site
explains how to install the package, configure access to your OTOBO or Znuny instance,
and automate routine tasks via the provided command-line tools and Python API.

Use the **Getting Started** section to learn how to set up credentials and run your first
requests. The **Interactive Installation Setup** guide walks through the interactive CLI
wizard that creates configuration files for you.
